                    Hey there! My name is Toby Jay and I am an aspiring software engineer and data scientist.
                    I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering and am pursuing a Masters Degreee in Computer Science at Loyola Marymount University.
                    I am passionate about using data and machine learning especially.
                    I enjoy playing on the Ultimate Frisbee team, lifting, cycling, and cooking up delicious food to fuel my endeavors.
                    If you need a driven and growth-oriented individual for a data or computer related challenge please contact me to explain what you're up against, I can share how I might help and we can see if there is a fit.
                    Check out some of the projects I have worked on in the projects tab!
